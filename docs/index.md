# Interactive Virtual Assistant

## Goal

Build a virtual assistant that can understand user intent, orchestrate tasks across tools, and deliver reliable results with minimal friction.

## Problem

Current assistants are either too rigid to handle real workflows or too brittle when tasks span multiple steps, tools, and systems. Users need consistent task execution, clear feedback, and safe automation that works across their daily stack.

## Proposed Solution

Create an interactive assistant that combines natural language understanding with explicit task planning and tool execution. It should keep the user in control, provide transparent actions, and integrate with common services so tasks are completed end-to-end.
